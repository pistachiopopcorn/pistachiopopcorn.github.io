            <p>In terms of balancing out the variety of spy movies out there, the movie deserves a metal. Both of its protagonists - Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon - are female, and this time Kunis wears the hawaiian shirt and works the dead beat job. But even though the movie was released in 2018, the feminist movement has come a long way since then so the plot feels a bit unoriginal: Woman protagonist has low self-esteem and an absentee boyfriend. But circumstances soon demonstrate to her (and the world) that she is actually resourceful, cunning, and worthy. In addition, it's a bit harder to accept this performance because we KNOW Mila Kunis is a badass! But, in the end, originality doesn't matter really because with Kate McKinnon at the helm of its comedy, the movie elicits authentic laughs around every corner.</p>
